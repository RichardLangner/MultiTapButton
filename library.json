  "description": "Simplify your code to identify single taps, double taps (in fact ANY number of consecutive taps), long presses (e.g. button held down for 10 seconds to access a function), button up and button down events, time the button has been pressed. Auto-repeat after button held down for a certain time. The code should run on most microcontrollers as it does not use interrupts or special registers",
